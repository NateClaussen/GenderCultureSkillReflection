					Culture Observations by attending Redemption Church

						<h2>Observations</h2>
						<p class="roboto-main">
							I had the opportunity to attend another church for
							this assignment to experience the culture that I am
							not as familiar with. I would say that I had a good
							experience and found it fascinating the small
							differences that made the culture of this church
							different from the one I normally attend. Briefly
							stated, the first thing that I noticed was that the
							tone of the meeting felt more casual as the dress
							code was more business casual vs what I would
							consider a “Sunday best.” Right when I walked into
							the service, I noticed that everyone just stayed
							standing up through the music and stayed standing
							until the pastor came out to deliver their sermon.
							The meeting was very Bible and Christ Centered, and
							the congregation seemed to pay close attention to
							what was being taught.

						<h2>Response</h2>
						<p class="roboto-main">
							The habitus was actually very familiar to me as I
							myself am a Christian. As I was able to attend this
							Christian church, it did not surprise me that the
							things that were talked about, felt, and shared were
							already familiar things to me. There were
							differences in the way the meeting was ran that were
							different from what I was used to, but it helped me
							to learn that some cultures can be very similar to
							your own. I also learned that even though I may not
							be familiar with a culture, I can still find
							similarities that make me feel comfortable and
							welcomed.

						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<p class="roboto-main">
							In the meeting that I attended, the meeting was
							about the churches core values and belief that they
							want to focus on. They specifically talked about
							multiplying in terms of service and helping the
							community as well as missionary work and expanding
							their church. I was also impressed with the love
							that everyone seemed to have for each other, and
							felt like the church had a culture of accepting
							those who are new. As seen in the picture, I was
							able to see one of the leaders at the church that I
							met on Weber State campus who originally invited me
							to their services. While I will stay strong in my
							current faith, I really value the opportunity that I
							had to experience this different culture and would
							even be open to going again. On the Culture
							Competence Continuum, I would say that this
							experience has put me in the “respect” category for
							these people.

					Gender Observations from the movie: Megamind
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<img
						src="images/MegamindFullCast.jpg"

					/>
					<div class="section-content">
						<h2>Observations</h2>
						<p class="roboto-main">
							Megamind is a movie that came out in 2010 which
							portrays two little alien babies’ different lives
							growing up on earth. One of them is very smart
							(Megamind) and the other can fly and has laser
							vision (Metro Man). Throughout the movie, there is
							also a main female character (Roxanne) who acts as a
							catalyst to move the story along. Throughout the
							movie, I noticed that out of the 5 main characters
							only one of them was a female. When Minion (the
							fish) acts as “Space Step Mom,” the way that they
							distinguish themselves as a female is with a wig and
							an apron implying that they follow the societal
							norms with being a female in the kitchen always
							providing good snacks.

						<h2>Response</h2>
						<p class="roboto-main">
							Roxanne, while fitting the gender role as a news
							reporter, develops a greater sense of character and
							breaks the stereotypes by being strong, independent,
							and not afraid to speak her mind. She is portrayed
							as very independent and not afraid to stand up for
							what she believes in. The example of Roxanne is
							showing that it is acceptable for both males and
							females to have their own opinion and to break the
							mold that society has put on them. The example of
							Minion being “space step mom” almost juxtaposes the
							example of Roxanne, because it shows minion in an
							apron always providing treats and being more of the
							stereotypical “kitchen women.” Both of these
							portrayals are neither a good or bad thing; rather,
							they allow the viewer of the film to think
							critically about the message of the movie.

						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<p class="roboto-main">
							Overall, I have learned a lot watching this movie
							through the lens of a student observing gender in
							society. I can see that the way that women are being
							portrayed in this movie shows that both men and
							women can have success. While the theme of the movie
							is good vs evil, the way that Megamind is able to go
							from evil to good shows that you do not have to be
							stuck where you are at. You can change and do not
							always have to be evil. Without the distinct roles
							of male and female in the movie, the message being
							portrayed would not have been the same.
